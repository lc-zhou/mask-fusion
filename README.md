### Introduction:
Mask fusion  uses complementary masks for speech enhancement.  
The codes in mask-fusion/support are created by others:

1.SpectralNormalizationKeras.py (https://github.com/IShengFang/SpectralNormalizationKeras)

2.utils.py / signal_processing.py (https://github.com/fgnt/nn-gev/tree/master/fgnt)

Thanks for their sharing. And we also thank JasonSWFu's code (https://github.com/JasonSWFu/MetricGAN), which help a lot for our implementation of code.
